## Development

1. If you're **brand new to Ruby and Rails**, please see [**Discourse as Your First Rails App**](http://blog.discourse.org/2013/04/discourse-as-your-first-rails-app/) or our [**Discourse Vagrant Developer Guide**](docs/VAGRANT.md), which includes a development environment in a virtual machine.

2. If you're familiar with how Rails works and are comfortable setting up your own environment, use our [**Discourse Advanced Developer Guide**](docs/DEVELOPER-ADVANCED.md).

Before you get started, ensure you have the following minimum versions: [Ruby 2.3+](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), [PostgreSQL 9.3+](http://www.postgresql.org/download/), [Redis 2.6+](http://redis.io/download). If you're having trouble, please see our [**TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) first!

## Setting up Discourse

If you want to set up a Discourse forum for production use, see our [**Discourse Install Guide**](docs/INSTALL.md).
